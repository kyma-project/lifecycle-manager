// ClientCache is an optimized concurrency-safe in-memory cache based on sync.Map.
// It is mainly written so that a program that needs multiple Clients in different goroutines
// can access them without recreation. It does this by holding a concurrency-safe reference map
// based on an access key (ClientCacheID). It is not optimized for multi-write scenarios, but rather
// append-only cases where clients are expected to live longer than their calling goroutine.
//
// It thus borrows the same optimizations from it:
// The ClientCache type is optimized for when the entry for a given
// key is only ever written once but read many times, as in caches that only grow.
