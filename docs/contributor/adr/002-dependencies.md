# ADR 002 - Dependencies

## Status

Accepted

## Context

TBD

Describe the problem of resolving dependencies outside of the consuming package (e.g., via composition root) vs. within the consuming package (depend on interface but provide convenience constructor, functional ops). How could a good strutucted composition root look like (not all in main.go)?

## Decision

TBD

## Consequence
