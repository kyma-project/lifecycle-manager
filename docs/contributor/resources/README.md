# Lifecycle Manager Resources

The API of Lifecycle Manager is based on Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs), which extend the Kubernetes API with custom additions. The CRDs allow Lifecycle Manager to manage clusters and modules. To inspect the specification of the Lifecycle Manager resources, see:

* [Kyma CRD](01-kyma.md)
* [Manifest CRD](02-manifest.md)
* [ModuleTemplateCRD](03-moduletemplate.md)
* [Watcher CRD](04-watcher.md)
* [ModuleReleaseMeta CRD](05-modulereleasemeta.md)

For more information on how the Module Catalog and Kyma CR are synchronized between the Kyma Control Plane (KCP) and SAP BTP, Kyma runtime (SKR) clusters, see the [Synchronization Between Kyma Control Plane and SAP BTP, Kyma Runtime](../08-kcp-skr-synchronization.md).

## Stability

See the list of CRs involved in Lifecycle Manager's workflow and their stability status:

| Version | Name                                                | Stability                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
