# Lifecycle Manager - Operations

## Metrics

Lifecycle Manager metrics are exposed over port `8080` through the metrics endpoint `/metrics`.

The following metrics are exposed:

The metrics are grouped by the following labels:
- `requeue_reason`: Indicates the reason for the requeue of the Lifecycle Manager [reconcilers](../contributor/02-controllers.md#controllers). The reasons include if there is a specific error, or the reason for the synchronization between the KCP and SKR clusters.
- `requeue_type`: Indicates whether the requeue is expected or not. The possible values are `intended` and `unexpected`.
- `kyma_name`: The Kyma CR name.
- `state`: The state of the module, Manifest or Kyma CRs. The possible values are `Error`, `Ready`, `Processing`, `Warning`, and `Deleting`.
- `shoot`: The name of the SKR cluster.
- `instance_id`: The instance id.
- `module_name`: The module name.
- `err_reason`: The error reason for the purge reconciler. The possible values are `PurgeFinalizerRemovalError` and `CleanupError`.
- `manifest_name`: The name of the Manifest CR.
