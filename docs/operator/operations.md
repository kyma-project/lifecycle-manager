# Lifecycle Manager - Operations

## Metrics

Lifecycle Manager metrics are exposed over port 8080 through the metrics endpoint "/metrics".

The following metrics are exposed:

### General metrics:
#### lifecycle_mgr_requeue_reason_total
This metric is a counter vector that indicates the requeue reason of a reconciler.

### Kyma related metrics:
#### lifecycle_mgr_kyma_state
This metric is a gauge vector that indicates the state of a Kyma CR.
#### lifecycle_mgr_module_state
This metric is a gauge vector that indicates the state of a module enabled on a Kyma CR.

### Mandatory Modules related metrics:
#### lifecycle_mgr_mandatory_modules
This metric is a gauge that indicates the number of mandatory ModuleTemplates.
#### lifecycle_mgr_mandatory_module_state
This metric is a gauge vector that indicates the state of a mandatory module enabled on a Kyma CR.

### Manifest related metrics:
#### reconcile_duration_seconds
This metric is a gauge vector that indicates the duration of a manifest reconciliation in seconds.

### Purge related metrics:
#### lifecycle_mgr_purgectrl_time
This metric is a gauge that indices the average duration of purge reconciliation.
#### lifecycle_mgr_purgectrl_requests_total
This metric is a counter that indicates the total number of purges.
#### lifecycle_mgr_purgectrl_error
This metric is a gauge vector that indicates the errors produced by purge.

### Watcher related metrics:
#### lifecycle_mgr_self_signed_cert_not_renew
This metric is a gauge vector that indicates that the self-signed Certificate of a Kyma CR is not renewed yet.

## Dashboards
The above-mentioned metrics are visualized using Grafana and grouped into four dashboards:

### 1. Lifecycle Manager Overview
This dashboard gives an overview of the Lifecycle Manager. It includes the following:

#### Lifecycle Manager Kube API Request Rate
This panel shows the rate of requests to the Kubernetes API server.

This panel shows the memory usage of the Lifecycle Manager.

#### Lifecycle Manager CPU Usage
This panel shows the CPU usage of the Lifecycle Manager.

#### Lifecycle Manager Controller Runtime Reconcile Success
This panel is time series that shows the success rate of all the reconcilers.

#### Operator Controller Runtime Reconcile Errors
This panel is a time series that shows the errors produced by all the reconcilers.

#### Max Workers
This panel shows the maximum number of workers used by the Kyma and Manifest reconcilers.

#### Active workers
This panel shows the number of active workers used by the Kyma and Manifest reconcilers.

#### Workqueue Longest running processor seconds
This panel indicates how many seconds has the longest running processor for workqueue been running.

#### Workqueue Unfinished Work Seconds
This panel indicates how many seconds of work has been done that is in progress and hasnâ€™t been observed by work_duration. Large values indicate stuck threads.

#### Self-signed Certificate Not Renew
This panel indicates the self-signed Certificate of related Kyma is not renewed yet.

#### Purge Duration Seconds
This panel shows the duration of the purge reconciliation.

#### Purge Count
This panel shows the total number of purges.

#### Purge Errors
This panel shows the errors produced by the purge.

Some prometheus rules are in place to alert if some metrics are not in the expected state:

1. The lifecycle_mgr_self_signed_cert_not_renew metric has the value of 1 for 30 minutes, indicating that the Kyma self-signed certificate renewal buffer time has been exceeded by 30 minutes.
