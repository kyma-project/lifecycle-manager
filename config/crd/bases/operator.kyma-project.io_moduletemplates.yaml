        description: ModuleTemplate is a representation of a Template used for creating
          Module Instances within the Module Lifecycle. It is generally loosely defined
          within the Kubernetes Specification, however it has a strict enforcement
          of OCM guidelines as it serves an active role in maintaining a list of available
          Modules within a cluster.

                  generate the Module. It contains a default set of values for a given
                  channel, and is thus different from default values allocated during
                  struct parsing of the Module. While Data can change after the initial
                  creation of ModuleTemplate, it is not expected to be propagated
                  to downstream modules as it is considered a set of default values.
                  This means that an update of the data block will only propagate
                  to new Modules created form ModuleTemplate, not any existing Module.
