## Overview

Lifecycle Manager is an operator based on the [Kubebuilder](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder) framework. It extends Kubernetes API by providing multiple Custom Resource Definitions, which allow you to manage their resources through custom resources (CR). For more information, see [Lifecycle Manager Resources](./docs/contributor/resources/README.md).

Lifecycle Manager manages the lifecycle of [Kyma Modules](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/kyma-modules) in a cluster. It was introduced along with the concept of Kyma [modularizaion](https://github.com/kyma-project/community/tree/main/concepts/modularization).

For more information on the Lifecycle Manager's workflow, see the [Architecture](docs/contributor/01-architecture.md) document.

## Usage
