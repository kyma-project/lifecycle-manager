// DiffCalc calculates the difference between two slices of objects for which a string-based identity can be defined.
// The provided identity function should return the smallest unique string representation of the object.
// Note: For most types one can find a unique string identity, but for some types it might not be possible or practical: one example would be a built-in map[k]v type.
//
//	In such cases, the DiffCalc type should not be used.
